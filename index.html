        <h1>Food Gentrification</h1>
        <p>We will be discussing the process and impact of food gentrification. Our team will share some personal experience and new knowledged learned as well. The process where food items and stores are often affordable are pushed out due to new factors moving into the community making it “trendy” and more “upscale”. Lack of accessibility of quality food, ultimately making it inaccessible to the communities inhabited.

        <h1>Gentrification</h1>
        <p>
            Gentrification occurs when people with higher incomes relative to an area move to a neighborhood. The effects of gentrification may result in the current members of the community being displaced/forced to move due to the rising cost due to being out priced in their neighborhood.

            <ul>
                <li>Some farmers markets in Oakland tend to what will make the most profit or is “trendy” rather than being an outlet for access to fresh quality food. Pushing out long standing Black owned businesses and community grocers. New cafes and these organic markets will have high prices serving wealthier residents</li>
