            <p>
                We will be discussing the process and impact of food gentrification. Our team will share some personal experience and new knowledged learned as well. The process where food items and stores are often affordable are pushed out due to new factors moving into the community making it “trendy” and more “upscale”. Lack of accessibility of quality food, ultimately making it inaccessible to the communities inhabited.

                Gentrification occurs when people with higher incomes relative to an area move to a neighborhood. The effects of gentrification may result in the current members of the community being displaced/forced to move due to the rising cost due to being out priced in their neighborhood.

                <h3>West Oakland</h3>
                <p>
                    Some farmers markets in Oakland tend to what will make the most profit or is “trendy” rather than being an outlet for access to fresh quality food. Pushing out long standing Black owned businesses and community grocers. New cafes and these organic markets will have high prices serving wealthier residents

                <h3>San Francisco</h3>
                <p>
                    Some bakeries in San Francisco's Mission District, like La Victoria and Domínguez, have struggled to survive as the neighborhood changes. Rising rents and new businesses pushed out these long-standing community spaces that served generations of Latinx families. When they closed, it felt like a piece of the neighborhood's heart was lost, replaced by shops catering to wealthier newcomers.

            <div class="example">
                <h3>San Jose</h3>
                <p>
                    As Silicon Valley continues to grow the gentrification follows alongside it. Areas of Downtown San Jose are the hearts of technology companies as well as many places in the South Bay. As these companies come in the city has new people to cater to switching their demographic focus and the needs/wants of people who are newcomers. This impacts neighborhoods creating a focus on urban living which has driven up property values.
